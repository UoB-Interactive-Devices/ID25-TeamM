Course Goals
Design an Innovative Interactive Device:

Develop a creative device concept that addresses user needs.
Ensure the concept has novelty and is not simply reinventing existing products.
Learn to Prototype:

Utilize tools like Arduino, sensors, 3D printers, laser cutters, and other hardware to build a working prototype.
Combine sensors, motors, LEDs, or other components to create an interactive experience.
Conduct User Evaluations:

Test your prototype with users to gather feedback on its performance and usability.
Use evaluation methods, especially in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), to refine your design.
Document and Share Your Work:

Write a scientific-style paper documenting your process, with the potential for submission to an HCI conference (like CHI).
Key Requirements
Novelty: The project must offer something new, either in functionality, user interaction, or design. Avoid replicating products that already exist unless you add a unique twist.
Interactivity: The device should involve a meaningful interaction between humans and technology, emphasizing emotional or practical engagement.
Project Development Stages
Ideation and Market Analysis (Week 1):

Brainstorm 3 potential ideas per team.
Research existing solutions to ensure your concept is unique.
Start thinking about technical feasibility and user needs.
Prototyping and Refinement (Weeks 2â€“3):

Receive deeper training on tools like Arduino, sensors, and 3D printing.
Scope the technical and design requirements with TAs.
Begin building and iterating on your prototype.
Specialization and Execution (Week 4 onwards):

Define team roles and responsibilities.
Create a build plan, ensuring tasks are distributed effectively.
Iterate based on user feedback and technical challenges.
Final Presentation:

Showcase your prototype.
Discuss its novelty, technical implementation, and user impact.
