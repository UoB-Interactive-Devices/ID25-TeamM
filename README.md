Team members:

Ideas:
Desktop focus assistant:
- A plant/animal that reacts to your presence and behaviour at your desk
- It would have a timer to determine how long you have been working
- A positive display that improves the longer you work
- Possible I/O mechanisms include infrared, motion sensor, could play music, lights
- Potentially an application to track your screen time
- You could have a holder for you phone, if you reach for it too early it has a negative reaction

Interactive plant pot:
- Sensors to measure air and soil humidity
- Maybe an LDR to detect sunlight
- If we specify the plant beforehand, it could have a frame/structure to grow it in
- Sensors to monitor plant health?
- Phone application to interact with it
