Ideas:

Desktop focus assistant:
- A plant/animal that reacts to your presence and behaviour at your desk
- It would have a timer to determine how long you have been working
- A positive display that improves the longer you work
- Possible I/O mechanisms include infrared, motion sensor, could play music, lights
- Potentially an application to track your screen time or to schedule work/rest times
- You could have a holder for you phone, if you reach for it too early it has a negative reaction
- Could play white noise until the time is up and calming music or a playlist when resting. Maybe plug into phone and pause the playlist until it's time to play music

Novelty: Traditional Pomodoro tools often rely on digital timers with limited engagement, leading to user disconnection. 
This idea introduces a novel approach by merging the Pomodoro technique with tangible, biofeedback-inspired interaction.

Interactive plant pot:
- Sensors to measure air and soil humidity
- Maybe an LDR to detect sunlight
- If we specify the plant beforehand, it could have a frame/structure to grow it in
- Sensors to monitor plant health?
- Phone application to interact with it
