### Ideas:

#### Desktop focus assistant:
- A plant/animal that reacts to your presence and behaviour at your desk
- It would have a timer to determine how long you have been working
- A positive display that improves the longer you work
- Possible I/O mechanisms include infrared, motion sensor, could play music, lights
- Potentially an application to track your screen time or to schedule work/rest times
- You could have a holder for you phone, if you reach for it too early it has a negative reaction
- Could play white noise until the time is up and calming music or a playlist when resting. Maybe plug into phone and pause the playlist until it's time to play music

Novelty: Traditional Pomodoro tools often rely on digital timers with limited engagement, leading to user disconnection. 
This idea introduces a novel approach by merging the Pomodoro technique with tangible, biofeedback-inspired interaction.

#### Interactive plant pot:
- Sensors to measure air and soil humidity
- Maybe an LDR to detect sunlight
- If we specify the plant beforehand, it could have a frame/structure to grow it in
- Sensors to monitor plant health?
- Phone application to interact with it

### Project Overview

The Focus Assistant is a desktop productivity device designed to help users maintain focus while working or studying. It takes the form of a plant that "grows" or "wilts" in response to the user's behavior. By providing a visual and auditory representation of work progress, it encourages users to stay on task for a predetermined period.

----
### Who Will Use It?

- Individuals working or studying at a desk.

- People who struggle with distractions and need a visual or interactive cue to maintain focus.

----
### Usage

- The device will be placed next to the user's computer to accompany them while they study or work.

- The user sets the concentration duration by adjusting a knob.

- During the set focus time, the plant provides visual feedback based on the user's behaviour and focus on their work.

----
### How It Works

#### Reward Mechanism

- Progress Indicator: As users continue working, the plant gradually brightens from root to tip, and begins to "grow", symbolizing growth and fostering a sense of responsibility.

- Interruption Detection: If the user stops working (e.g., leaves the desk), the plant pauses its growth and may emit a soft auditory cue as a gentle reminder.

- Focus Completion: If the user successfully completes the set time, the plant plays a happy song or provides another positive reinforcement.

- Distraction Handling: If the user gets distracted for an extended period, the plant starts to droop or wilt, potentially playing a sad sound.
