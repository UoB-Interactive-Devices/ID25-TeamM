Write-up:
We believe that our companion should aim to build an emotional connection with the user. To achieve this, and to have a user-friendly design, both in terms of ergonomics and in aesthetics. To further build a connection, we'd also like it to have some sort of persistence of behaviour or memory to encourage lasting bonds. To accommodate a wider range of users, we would like it to have multiple input/output formats.
